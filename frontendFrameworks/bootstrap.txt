Bootstrap

https://getbootstrap.com/
    
    Bootstrap is a front end framework used to design responsive web pages and applications. 
    It takes a mobile-first approach to web development, and includes pre-built CSS styles and classes, plus some JavaScript functionality.

    In this course, you'll learn how to build responsive websites with Bootstrap, 
    and use its included classes to style buttons, images, forms, navigation, and other common elements.

Bootstrap will figure out how wide your screen is and respond by resizing 
your HTML elements - hence the name responsive design.

With responsive design, there is no need to design a mobile version of your website. 
It will look good on devices with screens of any width.

You can add Bootstrap to any app by adding the following code to the top of your HTML:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous"/>

        
    la clase container-fluid determina que lo de adentro es bootstrap responsive

        <div class="container-fluid">
        </div>

        class="img-responsive"  
            to img element

        class="text-center"      
            can center our heading element

        <button class="btn btn-default"></button>
            Bootstrap has its own styles for button elements, which look much better than the plain HTML ones.

        <button class="btn btn-default btn-block">Submit</button>
            This button would take up 100% of the available width.
            btn-block 
            will stretch to fill your page's entire horizontal space 
            and any elements following it will flow onto a "new line"
            Note that these buttons still need the btn class.

        class="btn-primary"
            is the main color you'll use in your app.

        Bootstrap comes with several pre-defined colors for buttons. 
            The btn-info class 
            is used to call attention to optional actions that the user can take.

            The btn-danger 
            class is the button color you'll use to notify users 
            that the button performs a destructive action


    Bootstrap uses a responsive 12-column grid system, 
    which makes it easy to put elements into rows and specify each element's relative width. 
    Most of Bootstrap's classes can be applied to a div element.

    Bootstrap has different column width attributes 
    that it uses depending on how wide the user's screen is. 
    For example, phones have narrow screens, and laptops have wider screens.

    Take for example Bootstrap's 
        col-md-* class. 
    Here, md means medium, and * is a number specifying how many columns wide the element should be. 
    In this case, the column width of an element on a medium-sized screen, such as a laptop, is being specified.

    col-xs-*, 
    where xs means extra small (like an extra-small mobile phone screen), 
    and * is the number of columns specifying how many columns wide the element should be.
        example: <div class="col-xs-4">

        con los col-tamanho-cantidad
        determinamos la cantidad de columnas que va usar el elemento
        con bootstrap cada row esta hecha con un grid de 12 columnas

    row class 
        has
            margin-right: -15px;
            margin-left: -15px;
        properties


    inline solo usa el espacio que necesita
    block usa todo el ancho

    una forma de armar un header sencillo recordando que bootstrap uses a responsive grid system
    es poner x ej 2 elementos dentro de un div 'row' y cada elemento dentro de otro div
    uno clase 'col-xs-8' y otro clase 'col-xs-4'
    uno va a ocupar 8/12 y el otro 4/12 de ancho



Add Font Awesome

    https://fontawesome.com/icons

    Font Awesome is a convenient library of icons. 
    These icons can be webfonts or vector graphics. 
    These icons are treated just like fonts. You can specify their size using pixels, 
    and they will assume the font size of their parent HTML elements.

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.1/css/all.css" 
        integrity="sha384-50oBUHEmvpQ+1lW4y57PTFmhCaXp0ML5d60M1M7uH2+nqUivzIebhndOJK28anvf" crossorigin="anonymous">

        The i element was originally used to make other elements italic, 
        but is now commonly used for icons. 
        You can add the Font Awesome classes to the i element to turn it into an icon, for example:

            <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i>
        
        Note that the span element is also acceptable for use with icons.
