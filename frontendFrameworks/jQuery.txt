    All jQuery functions start with a $

    para hacer uso de jQuery es necesario incluir la libreria en el documento

    <script></script>

        Your browser will run any JavaScript inside a script element, including jQuery.    


    $(document).ready(function() {
        });
    
        that code you put inside this function 
        will run as soon as your browser has loaded your page.
    
        This is important because without your document ready function, 
        your code may run before your HTML is rendered, which would cause bugs.

    
    jQuery often selects an HTML element with a selector, then does something to that element.

        For example, let's make all of your button elements bounce.

            $("button").addClass("animated bounce");

            estas clases pertenecen a una libreria Animate.css
        
        $("button") select all button elements
        .addClass() function, which allows you to add classes to elements.
        $(".well") select all elements with .well class
        $("#id") select all elements with #id id

        just like with CSS declarations

            by type: $("button"), by class: $(".btn"), and by id $("#target1").


        removeClass()
            $("#elementId").removeClass("name-class");


        
        .css() 
            allows you to change the CSS of an element.
                $("#elementId").css("color", "blue");

    

    You can also change the non-CSS properties of HTML elements with jQuery. 
    For example, you can disable buttons.
        
        .prop()
            jQuery has a function called .prop() that allows you to adjust the properties of elements.
                $("button").prop("disabled", true);

    
    Using jQuery, you can change the text between the start and end tags of an element. You can even change HTML markup.
        .html()
            jQuery has a function called .html() that lets you add HTML tags and text within an element. 
            Any content previously within the element will be completely replaced 
            with the content you provide using this function.    
            Here's how you would rewrite and emphasize the text of our heading:
                $("h3").html("<em>jQuery Playground</em>");

        jQuery also has a similar function called .text() that only alters text without adding tags.
        In other words, this function will not evaluate any HTML tags passed to it, 
        but will instead treat it as the text you want to replace the existing content with.


    remove()
        jQuery has a function called .remove() that will remove an HTML element entirely

    
    appendTo()
        jQuery has a function called appendTo() 
        that allows you to select HTML elements and append them to another element.
            $("#target4").appendTo("#left-well");


    clone()
        jQuery has a function called clone() that makes a copy of an element.
        For example, if we wanted to copy target2 from our left-well to our right-well, we would use:
            $("#target2").clone().appendTo("#right-well");

    
    parent()
        jQuery has a function called parent() 
        that allows you to access the parent of whichever element you've selected.
            $("#left-well").parent().css("background-color", "blue")


    children()
        children() that allows you to access the children of whichever element you've selected.
            $("#left-well").children().css("color", "blue")


    target:nth-child(n) 
        CSS selector allows you to select all the nth elements with the target class or element type.
            $(".target:nth-child(3)").addClass("animated bounce");


    You can also target elements based on their positions using 
        i:odd or :even selectors.
        first element in a selection has a position of 0
        :odd selects the second element (position 1), fourth element (position 3), and so on.
            $(".target:odd").addClass("animated shake");
