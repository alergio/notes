display     #display 

    The display CSS property sets whether an element is treated as a block or inline element 
    and the layout used for its children, such as flow layout, grid or flex.

    Formally, the display property sets an element's inner and outer display types. 
    The outer type sets an element's participation in flow layout; the inner type sets the layout of children. Som
    e values of display are fully defined in their own individual specifications; 
    for example the detail of what happens when display: flex is declared is defined in the CSS Flexible Box Model specification.

    Outside
        block
            The element generates a block element box, 
            generating line breaks both before and after the element when in the normal flow.

        inline
            The element generates one or more inline element boxes 
            that do not generate line breaks before or after themselves. 
            In normal flow, the next element will be on the same line if there is space.

    Inside
        flow 
            The element lays out its contents using flow layout (block-and-inline layout).
            If its outer display type is inline or run-in, 
            and it is participating in a block or inline formatting context, 
            then it generates an inline box. 
            Otherwise it generates a block container box.

        flow-root
            The element generates a block element box 
            that establishes a new block formatting context, 
            defining where the formatting root lies.

        table
            These elements behave like HTML <table> elements. 
            It defines a block-level box.

        flex
            The element behaves like a block element and 
            lays out its content according to the flexbox model.

        grid
            The element behaves like a block element and 
            lays out its content according to the grid model.

        ruby 
        The element behaves like an inline element and 
        lays out its content according to the ruby formatting model.

    Precomposed
        inline-block
            The element generates a block element box that will be flowed with 
            surrounding content as if it were a single inline box (behaving much like a replaced element would).
            It is equivalent to inline flow-root.

        inline-table
            The inline-table value does not have a direct mapping in HTML. 
            It behaves like an HTML <table> element, but as an inline box, rather than a block-level box. 
            Inside the table box is a block-level context.
            It is equivalent to inline table.

        inline-flex
            The element behaves like an inline element and 
            lays out its content according to the flexbox model.
            It is equivalent to inline flex.

        inline-grid
            The element behaves like an inline element
            and lays out its content according to the grid model.
            It is equivalent to inline grid.    


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

overflow #overflow

    sets the desired behavior for an element's overflow

    The overflow property is specified as one or two keywords chosen from the list of values below. 
    If two keywords are specified, the first applies to overflow-x and the second to overflow-y. 
    Otherwise, both overflow-x and overflow-y are set to the same value.

    visible
        Content is not clipped and may be rendered outside the padding box.

    hidden
        Content is clipped if necessary to fit the padding box. 
        No scrollbars are provided, and no support for allowing the user to scroll 
        (such as by dragging or using a scroll wheel) is allowed. 
        The content can be scrolled programmatically 
        (for example, by setting the value of a property such as scrollLeft or the scrollTo() method), 
        so the element is still a scroll container.

    clip
        Similar to hidden, the content is clipped to the element's padding box. 
        The difference between clip and hidden is that the clip keyword also forbids all scrolling, including programmatic scrolling. 
        The box is not a scroll container, and does not start a new formatting context. 
        If you wish to start a new formatting context, you can use display: flow-root to do so.

    scroll
        Content is clipped if necessary to fit the padding box. 
        Browsers always display scrollbars whether or not any content is actually clipped, 
        preventing scrollbars from appearing or disappearing as content changes. Printers may still print overflowing content.

    auto
        Depends on the user agent. 
        If content fits inside the padding box, it looks the same as visible, 
        but still establishes a new block formatting context. 
        Desktop browsers provide scrollbars if content overflows.

    overlay
        Behaves the same as auto, but with the scrollbars drawn on top of content instead of taking up space.

filter property     #filter #filterproperty #propertyfilter #filter-p

    The filter CSS property applies graphical effects like blur or color shift to an element. 
    Filters are commonly used to adjust the rendering of images, backgrounds, and borders.

    blur()
        The blur(radius) function applies a Gaussian blur to the input image. 
        The value of radius defines the value of the standard deviation to the Gaussian function, 
        or how many pixels on the screen blend into each other, so a larger value will create more blur. 
        The initial value for interpolation is 0. 
        The parameter is specified as a CSS length, but does not accept percentage values.
            filter: blur(5px)

    brightness()
        The brightness() function applies a linear multiplier to the input image, making it appear more or less bright. 
        A value of 0% will create an image that is completely black. 
        A value of 100% leaves the input unchanged. 
        Other values are linear multipliers on the effect. 
        Values of an amount over 100% are allowed, providing brighter results. 
        The initial value for interpolation is 1.
            filter: brightness(2)

    contrast()
        The contrast() function adjusts the contrast of the input image. 
        A value of 0% will create an image that is completely gray. 
        A value of 100% leaves the input unchanged. 
        Values of an amount over 100% are allowed, providing results with more contrast. 
        The initial value for interpolation is 1.
            filter: contrast(200%)

    dropshadow()    
        The drop-shadow() function applies a drop shadow effect to the input image. 
        A drop shadow is effectively a blurred, offset version of the 
        input image's alpha mask drawn in a particular color, composited below the image. 
        The function accepts a parameter of type <shadow>, 
        with the exception that the inset keyword and spread parameter are not allowed. 
        This function is similar to the more established box-shadow property; 
        the difference is that with filters, some browsers provide hardware acceleration for better performance. 
        The parameters of the <shadow> parameter are as follows:

            <offset-x> <offset-y> (required)
                These are two <length> values to set the shadow offset. 
                <offset-x> specifies the horizontal distance. 
                Negative values place the shadow to the left of the element. 
                <offset-y> specifies the vertical distance. 
                Negative values place the shadow above the element. 
                If both values are 0, the shadow is placed behind the element 
                (and may generate a blur effect if <blur-radius> and/or <spread-radius> is set).

            <blur-radius> (optional)
                This is a third <length> value. 
                The larger this value, the bigger the blur, so the shadow becomes bigger and lighter. 
                Negative values are not allowed. 
                If not specified, it will be 0 (the shadow's edge is sharp).

            <color> (optional)
                See <color> values for possible keywords and notations. 
                If not specified, the color used depends on the browser - 
                it is usually the value of the <color> property, 
                but note that Safari currently paints a transparent shadow in this case.

        filter: drop-shadow(16px 16px 10px black)
    
    grayscale()
        The grayscale() function converts the input image to grayscale (black and white). 
        The value of amount defines the proportion of the conversion. 
        A value of 100% is completely grayscale. 
        A value of 0% leaves the input unchanged. 
        Values between 0% and 100% are linear multipliers on the effect. 
        The initial value for interpolation is 0.
            filter: grayscale(100%)

    hue-rotate()
        The hue-rotate() function applies a hue rotation on the input image. 
        The value of angle defines the number of degrees around the color circle the input samples will be adjusted. 
        A value of 0deg leaves the input unchanged. 
        The initial value for interpolation is 0. 
        Though there is no maximum value; the effect of values above 360deg wraps around.
            filter: hue-rotate(90deg)

    invert()
        The invert() function inverts the samples in the input image. 
        The value of amount defines the proportion of the conversion. 
        A value of 100% is completely inverted. 
        A value of 0% leaves the input unchanged. 
        Values between 0% and 100% are linear multipliers on the effect. 
        The initial value for interpolation is 0.
            filter: invert(100%)

    opacity()
        The opacity() function applies transparency to the samples in the input image. 
        The value of amount defines the proportion of the conversion. 
        A value of 0% is completely transparent. 
        A value of 100% leaves the input unchanged. 
        Values between 0% and 100% are linear multipliers on the effect. 
        This is equivalent to multiplying the input image samples by amount. 
        The initial value for interpolation is 1. 
        This function is similar to the more established opacity property; 
        the difference is that with filters, some browsers provide hardware acceleration for better performance.
            filter: opacity(50%)

    saturate()
        The saturate() function saturates the input image. 
        The value of amount defines the proportion of the conversion. 
        A value of 0% is completely un-saturated. 
        A value of 100% leaves the input unchanged. 
        Other values are linear multipliers on the effect. 
        Values of amount over 100% are allowed, providing super-saturated results. 
        The initial value for interpolation is 1.
            filter: saturate(200%)

    sepia()
        The sepia() function converts the input image to sepia. 
        The value of amount defines the proportion of the conversion. 
        A value of 100% is completely sepia. 
        A value of 0% leaves the input unchanged. 
        Values between 0% and 100% are linear multipliers on the effect. 
        The initial value for interpolation is 0.
            filter: sepia(100%)

transform property #transform #transformproperty #transform-property #propertytransform

    The transform CSS property lets you rotate, scale, skew, or translate an element.
    we use this with
    Cartesian coordinates
        In the Cartesian coordinate system, 
        a two-dimensional point is described using two values: 
        an x coordinate (abscissa) and a y coordinate (ordinate). 
        This is represented by the vector notation (x, y).

    matrix()
        The matrix() CSS function defines a homogeneous 2D transformation matrix.
        is specified with six values. 
        The constant values are implied and not passed as parameters; 
        the other parameters are described in the column-major order.
        
        matrix(a, b, c, d, tx, ty)
            a b c d
            Are <number>s describing the linear transformation.
            tx ty
            Are <number>s describing the translation to apply.
        The values represent the following functions: 
        matrix(scaleX(), skewY(), skewX(), scaleY(), translateX(), translateY())

            transform: matrix(1, 2, -1, 1, 80, 80);
    

    matrix3d()   
        The matrix3d() CSS function defines a 3D transformation as a 4x4 homogeneous matrix.
        The matrix3d() function is specified with 16 values. 
        They are described in the column-major order.

        matrix3d(a1, b1, c1, d1, a2, b2, c2, d2, a3, b3, c3, d3, a4, b4, c4, d4)
            a1 b1 c1 d1 a2 b2 c2 d2 a3 b3 c3 d3
            Are <number>s describing the linear transformation.
            a4 b4 c4 d4
            Are <number>s describing the translation to apply.
     
        see examples of this on the web


    perspective()
        The perspective() CSS function 
        defines a transformation that sets the distance between the user and the z=0 plane, 
        the perspective from which the viewer would be if the 2-dimensional interface were 3-dimensional.

        The perspective distance used by perspective() is specified by a <length> value, 
        which represents the distance between the user and the z=0 plane, or by none. 
        The z=0 plane is the plane where everything appears in a 2-dimensional view, or the screen. 
        Negative values are syntax errors. 
        Values smaller than 1px (including zero) are clamped to 1px. 
        Values other than none cause elements with positive z positions to appear larger, 
        and elements with negative z positions to appear smaller. 
        Elements with z positions equal to or larger than the perspective value disappear as though they are behind the user. 
        Large values of perspective represent a small transformation; 
        small values of perspective() represent a large transformation; 
        perspective(none) represents perspective from infinite distance and no transformation. 
            transform: perspective(400px)


    rotate()
        The rotate() CSS function defines a transformation that rotates 
        an element around a fixed point on the 2D plane, without deforming it.
        The fixed point that the element rotates around — mentioned above — 
        is also known as the transform origin. This defaults to the center of the element

        The amount of rotation created by rotate() is specified by an <angle>. 
        If positive, the movement will be clockwise; 
        if negative, it will be counter-clockwise. 
        A rotation by 180° is called point reflection.
            transform: rotate(45deg);


    rotate3d()
        see info about this on the web


    rotateX()
        The rotateX() CSS function defines a transformation that rotates 
        an element around the abscissa (horizontal axis) without deforming it.
        The amount of rotation created by rotateX() is specified by an <angle>. 
        If positive, the movement will be clockwise; if negative, it will be counter-clockwise.
            transform: rotateX(45deg);


    rotateY()
        The rotateY() CSS function defines a transformation 
        that rotates an element around the ordinate (vertical axis) without deforming it.
        The amount of rotation created by rotateY() is specified by an <angle>. 
        If positive, the movement will be clockwise; if negative, it will be counter-clockwise.
            transform: rotateY(180deg);

    
    rotateZ()
        The rotateZ() CSS function defines a transformation 
        that rotates an element around the z-axis without deforming it.
        Note: rotateZ(a) is equivalent to rotate(a)
        The amount of rotation created by rotateZ() is specified by an <angle>. 
        If positive, the movement will be clockwise; if negative, it will be counter-clockwise.
            transform: rotateZ(45deg);


    scale()
        The scale() CSS function defines a transformation that resizes an element on the 2D plane. 
        Because the amount of scaling is defined by a vector, 
        it can resize the horizontal and vertical dimensions at different scales.

        This scaling transformation is characterized by a two-dimensional vector. 
        Its coordinates define how much scaling is done in each direction. 
        If both coordinates are equal, the scaling is uniform (as if using only one parameter)
        
        When a coordinate value is outside the [-1, 1] range, 
        the element grows along that dimension; when inside, it shrinks. 
        A negative value results in a point reflection in that dimension. 
        The value 1 has no effect.

        The scale() function is specified with either one or two values, 
        which represent the amount of scaling to be applied in each direction.

            scale(sx)
            scale(sx, sy)
            transform: scale(0.7); /* Equal to scaleX(0.7) scaleY(0.7) */

    
    scale3d()
        see info about this on the web


    scaleX()
        The scaleX() CSS function defines a transformation 
        that resizes an element along the x-axis (horizontally).
        It modifies the abscissa of each element point by a constant factor, 
        except when the scale factor is 1, in which case the function is the identity transform.
            transform: scaleX(0.6);

    
    scaleY()
        The scaleY() CSS function defines a transformation 
        that resizes an element along the y-axis (vertically)
        It modifies the ordinate of each element point by a constant factor, 
        except when the scale factor is 1, in which case the function is the identity transform
            transform: scaleY(0.6);


    scaleZ()
        The scaleZ() CSS function defines a transformation 
        that resizes an element along the z-axis. 
        This scaling transformation modifies the z-coordinate of each element point by a constant factor, 
        except when the scale factor is 1, in which case the function is the identity transform.
        Note: scaleZ(sz) is equivalent to scale3d(1, 1, sz).
            transform: scaleZ(2)


    skew()
        The skew() CSS function defines a transformation 
        that skews an element on the 2D plane.
        This transformation is a shear mapping (transvection) 
        that distorts each point within an element by a certain angle in the horizontal and vertical directions

        The coordinates of each point are modified by a value proportionate 
        to the specified angle and the distance to the origin. 
        Thus, the farther from the origin a point is, the greater the value added to it.

        The skew() function is specified with either one or two values, 
        which represent the amount of skewing to be applied in each direction. 
        If you only specify one value it is used for the x-axis and there will be no skewing on the y-axis.
            transform: skew(10deg); /* Equal to skewX(10deg) */

    skewX()
        Skews an element in the horizontal direction.

    skewY()
        Skews an element in the vertical direction.


    translate()
        The translate() CSS function repositions 
        an element in the horizontal and/or vertical directions. 
        This transformation is characterized by a two-dimensional vector. 
        Its coordinates define how much the element moves in each direction.
            
            /* Single <length-percentage> values */
                transform: translate(200px);
                transform: translate(50%);

            /* Double <length-percentage> values */
                transform: translate(100px, 200px);
                transform: translate(100px, 50%);
                transform: translate(30%, 200px);
                transform: translate(30%, 50%);

        translate(2px) is equivalent to translate(2px, 0) (if don't define the vertical direction it will be 0)

    translate3d()
        Translates an element in 3D space.
        see info about this on the web

    translateX()
        Translates an element horizontally.

    translateY()
        Translates an element vertically.

    translateZ()
        Translates an element along the z-axis.

box-sizing property #box-sizingproperty #box-size

    The box-sizing CSS property sets how the total width and height of an element is calculated.

    By default in the CSS box model, 
    the width and height you assign to an element is applied only to the element's content box. 
    If the element has any border or padding, this is then added to the width and height 
    to arrive at the size of the box that's rendered on the screen. 
    This means that when you set width and height, 
    you have to adjust the value you give to allow for any border or padding that may be added. 
    For example, if you have four boxes with width: 25%;, 
    if any has left or right padding or a left or right border, 
    they will not by default fit on one line within the constraints of the parent container.

    The box-sizing property can be used to adjust this behavior:

    content-box 
        gives you the default CSS box-sizing behavior. 
        If you set an element's width to 100 pixels, 
        then the element's content box will be 100 pixels wide, 
        and the width of any border or padding will be added to the final rendered width, 
        making the element wider than 100px.

    border-box 
        tells the browser to account for any border and padding 
        in the values you specify for an element's width and height. 
        If you set an element's width to 100 pixels, 
        that 100 pixels will include any border or padding you added, 
        and the content box will shrink to absorb that extra width. 
        This typically makes it much easier to size elements. 
        box-sizing: border-box is the default styling that browsers use for the <table>, <select>, and <button> elements, 
        and for <input> elements whose type is radio, checkbox, reset, button, submit, color, or search.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

object-fit property #object #objectfit #object-fit

    The object-fit CSS property sets how the content of a replaced element, 
    such as an <img> or <video>, should be resized to fit its container.

    You can alter the alignment of the replaced element's content object 
    within the element's box using the object-position property.

    Values
        
        contain
            The replaced content is scaled to maintain its aspect ratio while fitting within the element's content box. 
            The entire object is made to fill the box, while preserving its aspect ratio, 
            so the object will be "letterboxed" if its aspect ratio does not match the aspect ratio of the box.

        cover
            The replaced content is sized to maintain its aspect ratio while filling the element's entire content box. 
            If the object's aspect ratio does not match the aspect ratio of its box, then the object will be clipped to fit.

        fill
            The replaced content is sized to fill the element's content box. 
            The entire object will completely fill the box. 
            If the object's aspect ratio does not match the aspect ratio of its box, then the object will be stretched to fit.

        none
            The replaced content is not resized.

        scale-down
            The content is sized as if none or contain were specified, 
            whichever would result in a smaller concrete object size.

gap property #gap

    The gap CSS property sets the gaps (gutters) between rows and columns. 
    It is a shorthand for row-gap and column-gap.

    Note that grid-gap is an alias for this property.

    This property is specified as a value for <'row-gap'> 
    followed optionally by a value for <'column-gap'>. 
    If <'column-gap'> is omitted, it's set to the same value as <'row-gap'>.

    <'row-gap'> and <'column-gap'> are each specified as a <length> or a <percentage>

        gap: 20px;
        gap: 20px 10px;

::after pseudoelement #after

    The ::after pseudo-element creates an element that is the last child of the selected element.
    It is often used to add cosmetic content to an element with the content property. 
    It is inline by default.

    this is useful when we have a center aligned flex container and we need 
    the last element to be left aligned, we can use this pseudoelement and set it to an empty
    string in its content and set it to the same width as the images, so the last image will be align left

        .exciting-text::after {
            content: " <- EXCITING!";
            color: green;
        }

        .boring-text::after {
            content: " <- BORING";
            color: red;
        }

        se usa para agregar contenido x al final de un elemento or however
